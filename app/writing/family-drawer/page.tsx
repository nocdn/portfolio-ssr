        It feels like whenever the topic of animations (whether that is web or otherwise) comes up,
        the{" "}

      <p className="max-w-2xl text-[#424242]">
        It represents incredible attention to detail and a deep understanding of animation
        principles. And for this very reason, when I originally started learning motion design, I
        had set aspects of this app as my goal to recreate.
      </p>
      <p className="max-w-2xl text-[#424242]">
        Naturally, the app is filled with lots of great interactions, but here, I will focus on just
        one of them, a wallet options drawer:
      </p>
      <div className="mx-auto my-4 flex max-w-2xl gap-6">

        </video>
        <p className="hidden text-[16px] text-gray-500/60 md:block">
          The drawer itself, straight from the app (2025). Choosing the "Remove Wallet" option
          closes the drawer and opens another confirmation dialog, so I did not include that in the
          video.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p className="max-w-2xl text-[#424242]">
        The most important aspect of this whole component is the motion, no doubt about that, so
        with my first attempt, I ignored the icons, colours and typography and ended up with this:

        <span className="code-inline">motion/react</span> is the library that provides the motion

        occurs as soon as the element is mounted, while <span className="code-inline">exit</span>{" "}

        play.
